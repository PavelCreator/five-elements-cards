Hi. Together we will create a board game using Angular.
We have a set of cards with their cost and bonuses and a set of illustrations for these cards. We need to join them. And Angular will help us with that.

Using this project we can:
* assign illustrations to cards
* make a horizontal reflection of the illustration, if it is visually advantageous (part of the image is hidden under the elements of the card cost)
* rename a game unit
* disable or enable illustrations
* switch screen split modes in percentage ratio
* export a set of final cards with illustrations
* reset everything to the original state

All settings and data are stored in the local storage of the user's browser.
The project is written on the latest version of Angular for spring 2025 and uses many innovations, such as standalone components, Signals, etc.
